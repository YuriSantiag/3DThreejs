            I am a freelance web developer specialized in bringing digital ideas to life. With over two years of experience, I have been focused on creating and optimizing a variety of websites, including institutional, corporate, and commercial ones. Additionally, I have a brief experience in cybersecurity. I utilize a range of technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, ReactJS, Blender, Figma, ThreeJs, Bootstrap, MySQL, TailwindJS, jQuery, and have prior experience with Java.
As a self-taught individual, I have developed additional skills in design and 3D modeling, using tools like Blender, Threejs, Photoshop, and Figma. Through this journey of continuous learning, I have gained the ability to adapt quickly and seek innovative and high-quality web solutions, always prioritizing understanding the specific needs of each client.
